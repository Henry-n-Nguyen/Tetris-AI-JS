[Tetris-JS]

## Features

- Classic Tetris gameplay
- Real-time graphical interface using HTML5 Canvas
- Autonomous gameplay powered by an AI algorithm
- Score tracking and high score recording
- Responsive design for optimal viewing on different devices
- Customizable settings and difficulty levels

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Tetris-AI-JS.git

2. Open the project folder:

   ```bash
   cd Tetris-JS

3. Open [__index.html__](https://github.com/Henry-n-Nguyen/Tetris-JS/edit/main/index.html) in your preferred web browser.

## Usage

- To play the game manually, use the arrow keys on your keyboard to control the falling Tetriminos and try to complete rows to score points.
- To watch the AI play the game autonomously, click the "AI Mode" button to enable the artificial intelligence. The AI algorithm will analyze the game state and make decisions automatically to optimize the score.

## Customization

You can customize various aspects of the game by modifying the following parameters in the __'script.js'__ file:

- __'GRID_WIDTH'__ and __'GRID_HEIGHT'__: Adjust the dimensions of the game grid.
- __'BLOCK_SIZE'__: Set the size of each Tetrimino block.
- __'AI_DELAY'__: Control the delay (in milliseconds) between AI moves.
- __'AI_LOOKAHEAD'__: Adjust the number of future moves the AI algorithm considers.

Feel free to experiment with these settings to find the configuration that suits your preferences.
